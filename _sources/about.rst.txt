In memory of John Hunter, we are pleased to announce the first SciPy John
Hunter Excellence in Plotting Competition. This open competition aims to
highlight the importance of quality plotting to scientific progress and
showcase the capabilities of the current generation of plotting software.
Participants are invited to submit scientific plots to be judged by a panel.
The winning entries will be announced and displayed at the conference.

NumFOCUS is graciously sponsoring cash prizes for the winners in the following
amounts:

1st prize: $500
2nd prize: $200
3rd prize: $100
We look forward to exciting submissions that push the boundaries of plotting,
in this, our first attempt at this kind of competition.
