magnitude and duration. Over 1600 genomes of Ebola virus, representing over 5%
of all known cases, have been sequenced by numerous groups operating across
the three most affected countries: Guinea (green), Sierra Leone (blue), and
Liberia (red). We used these genomes, as well as the information about when
and where they were collected, to infer the evolutionary history (phylogeny)
of the epidemic (upper right). Phylogenetic tree branches are coloured by
country (red, blue and green) and by inferred administrative division (lighter
colour indicating westerly areas).</p>
<p>The map (left) shows migrations inferred in the phylogeny as “missiles”,
coloured black if Ebola virus is moving within the same country, or by origin
colour if a lineage is moving internationally. Reported weekly new cases for
each administrative division in the map is represented by the polygon’s colour
intensity, with large numbers of new cases shown as darker colours.</p>
<p>A plot of new weekly cases reported by each country is shown in lower right,
coloured by country (Sierra Leone is blue, Liberia is red, Guinea is green).
At the height of the epidemic Sierra Leone (blue) was reporting ~700 new cases
per week.</p>
<p>Viral migration played a key role in the severity of the Ebola epidemic that
can be seen in the animation. An early migration occurring in March/April 2014
from Guinea (green) into neighbouring Sierra Leone (blue) gave rise to a
lineage that caused the vast majority of cases. Following this introduction
the virus raced rapidly westwards across Sierra Leone (blue) towards Freetown,
but also spread into nearby Liberia (red), causing a large outbreak centered
on Monrovia. During summer of 2014 Guinea (green) also suffered from multiple
back-spillover events, where viruses from both Liberia (red) and Sierra Leone
(blue) were re-introduced into Guinea (green). As the epidemic subsided in
early 2015 a clear region of continued transmission developed on the border of
Sierra Leone (blue) and Guinea (green), caused by rapidly migrating
transmission chains frequently hopping across country borders.</p>
